# Java Packager
A simple program to pack a Jar-File into a Windows-Executable.
> Tip: If u want to change the Icon use another Tool like Resource Hacker

# Features (Parameters)
- nogui: disables all the setup Interfaces, only Errors would still show up
- shell: turns the \*.exe into a Console-Application, switchable by adding/removing ".shell" in front of ".exe"
The Bytecode gets fully obfuscated and unreadable by any other program.

# Automatic-Use in an IDE
Run after the project build at the same directory as the Jar with the parameter "nogui"
